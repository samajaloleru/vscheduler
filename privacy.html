															<h2>OUR ETHICS</h2>
															
															<div class="text">
																<p>These are our guiding ethics regarding privacy;</p>
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li>
																				<strong>1.</strong>  The most fundamental privacy principle we follow is that by default, anything users post to vScheduler is private to the client that enabled that user. 
																				That is, viewing the appointments, activities, and messages posted or logged requires authentication as a user enabled by that client.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				<strong>2.</strong>   vScheduler is the custodian of data on behalf of the clients that use vScheduler. 
																				We DO NOT own client data. Clients own their data. They like it that way and so do we.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				<strong>3.</strong>   At vScheduler we believe that more transparency is better than less. We try to make our product easy to use, with settings and options that are easy to find and understand. 
																				This is good for privacy, good for the product, and good for vScheduler clients and users. To foster greater transparency, we publish a Transparency Report, which is a summary of government and law enforcement requests for user data and content removal from vScheduler. 
																				Our Data Request Policy explains our policy regarding user data and content removal requests.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				<strong>4.</strong>   We belive that having more easily accessible information that is searchable wherever you go, whatever device you have, is better than having less. 
																				So this is how we built vScheduler. Clients can select their own data retention policies (depending on their level of service). 
																				Clients can change these settings at their discretion, but the default settings aim to foster access to data and ease of use.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				<strong>5.</strong>   Privacy also involves security and confidentiality. Each is as important as the other and are all very important to us. We take them very seriously.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				<strong>6.</strong>   You can see past versions of our Privacy Policy, Terms of Service and other policies in our Policy Archive.

															<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
															<p>Updated: April 1, 2018</p>

															<blockquote>
																<div class="quote-text">If your organization is on an <strong>Extended Subscription</strong> License or a <strong>3-Year Value Subscription</strong> License with vScheduler, that Agreement may have modified the privacy policy below. Please contact your organization’s administrator for details.</div>
															</blockquote>

															<p>
																This privacy policy is here to help you understand what information we collect at vScheduler, how we use it, and what choices you have. 
																When we talk about vScheduler in this policy, we are talking about the vScheduler trademark, the vScheduler downloadable application, 
																and the vScheduler website at www.vscheduler.com, all of which are owned and managed by <strong>HASHNINE LLC</strong>. 
																vScheduler is available for use via a web browser or applications specific to your desktop or mobile device.
															</p>
															<p>
																This policy describes how vScheduler treats your information, not how other organizations treat your information. If you are using vScheduler in a workplace or on a device or account issued to you by your employer or another organization, 
																that company or organization likely has its own policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, and retention of communications and content which may apply to your use of vScheduler. Content that would otherwise be considered private to you or to a limited group of people may, in some cases, 
																accessible by the client company or facility administrator. Please check with your employer or administrator about the policies it has in place regarding your communications and related content on vScheduler. More on this below.
															</p>
															<p>
																In this policy we talk about various roles within a vScheduler account and the privileges that come with it. It is helpful to understand these roles and the relationships between them. Here is the breakdown:
															</p>
															
															<div class="text">
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li>
																				1. <strong>Client</strong>  - an enterprise or a facility management company
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				2. <strong>Super Administrator</strong>  - the primary enterprise representative or the facility manager
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				3. <strong>Administrator</strong>  - any vScheduler user with administrative privileges
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				4. <strong>User</strong>  - any enabled vScheduler user that can be authenticated
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																	</div>
																</div>
															</div>

															<p>
																Clients, via their super administrators, have the most control over their user’s settings on vScheduler, followed by administrators and then users themselves. The individual that establishes the vScheduler 
																account on behalf of their organization (the client company) is considered the super administrator and wields the most control over the account (which is why it is not a good idea for this individual to be 
																a contractor or temp employee). Accounts can have more than one administrator, but only one can be the super administrator. 
																The super administrator role can be transferred to another user after the account is created (see prior note about contractors and temp workers). All super administrators and administrators are also users.
															</p>
															
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															
															<h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND RECEIVE</h3>

															<p>
																We collect different kinds of information. Some of it is personally identifiable and some is non-identifying or aggregated. Here are the types of information we collect or receive:
															</p>
															
															<div class="text">
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li>
																				1. <strong>Account Information.</strong> When you create an account on vScheduler, we collect your email address (as the primary contact person for the account), your company or facility name, vScheduler domain (ex: your-company-name.vscheduler.com), your user name that appears in your vScheduler account, and password. 
																				Optionally, you can provide an email domain to allow people on that domain to sign up for access to the account without an invitation or individually add email addresses for people you’d like to invite to use the account team.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				2. <strong>Profile Information.</strong> The only information we require to create your vScheduler account is an email address and password. Optional information you can enter into your profile includes information such as your first and last name, what you do, and your phone number. Your employer/administrator(s) may request you to provide additional information about yourself in your profile, 
																				and vScheduler has limited control over such additional information collected. Any information you add to your profile is visible to other users using the same company account. Your profile information can be managed on your profile management page.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				3. <strong>Billing Information.</strong> If you purchase a subscription (other than an extended license) of vScheduler, our third party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				4. <strong>Log Data.</strong> When you use vScheduler, our servers automatically record information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our website or your mobile app sends when you’re using it. 
																				This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you visited before coming to vScheduler, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, information about your browser configuration and plug-ins, language preferences, and cookie data. Log data does not contain message content and is routinely deleted.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				5. <strong>Device Information.</strong> In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using vScheduler on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				6. <strong>Geo-location Information.</strong> Precise GPS from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. WiFi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				7. <strong>vScheduler Usage Information.</strong> This is information about which accounts, channels, users, features, content, and links you interact with within vScheduler and what integrations with related services you use.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				8. <strong>Service Integrations.</strong> If you integrate with a service on vScheduler we will connect that service to ours.
																				<div class="row justify-content-center">
																					<div class=" col-10">
																						<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																							<li class="py-1">
																								i. Depending on account settings, users may be able to add integrations to a channel or direct message conversation. Those integrations are viewable and maybe removable by the administrators or designated users.
																							</li>
																							<li class="py-1">
																								ii. We do not receive or store your passwords for any of these services.
																							</li>
																							<li class="py-1">
																								iii. If you add an integration, the third party provider of the integration may share certain information about your account with vScheduler. vScheduler is not responsible for how accounts may use and collect data through integrations.
																							</li>
																							<li class="py-1">
																								iv. An integration can be removed at any time. Removing an integration unbinds that integration on a go-forward basis. That does not, however, delete the content that was received from the integration and indexed within vScheduler. That content must be deleted manually.
																							</li>
																						</ul>
																					</div>
																				</div>
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				9. <strong>Information Sent or Receive within vScheduler. </strong> This includes:
																				<div class="row justify-content-center">
																					<div class=" col-10">
																						<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																							<li>
																								i. <strong>User schedule details.</strong> This content can include the time, location, and attendees of a meeting or event.
																							</li>
																							<li>
																								ii. <strong>Visitor details.</strong> This content can include the visitors' name, email address, and/or phone number.
																							</li>
																							<li>
																								iii. <strong>Message content.</strong> This content can include messages, pictures, files and video among other file types.
																							</li>
																							<li>
																								iv. When appointments, messages, or files were sent and by whom, when or if they were seen by you, and where you received them (via a web browser or the mobile app, for example).

															<h3>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

															<p>
																We use your information for the following:
															</p>
															
															<div class="text">
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li>
																				1. Providing the vScheduler service. We use information you provide to authenticate you and deliver message content to you and from you
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				2.	Understanding and improving our products. To make the product better we have to understand how users are using it. We have a fair bit of data about usage and we intend to use it many different ways to improve our products, including research. 
																					This policy is not intended to place any limits on what we do with usage data that is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer tied to a vScheduler user.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				3.	Investigating and preventing security breaches. We work hard to keep vScheduler secure and to prevent abuse and fraud.
																			</li><br/>
																			<li>
																				4. Communicating with you
																				<div class="row justify-content-center">
																					<div class=" col-10">
																						<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																							<li>
																								i. <strong>Solving problems and responding to requests.</strong> If you contact us with a problem or question, we will use your information to respond to that request and address your problems or concerns.
																							</li><br/>
																							<li>
																								ii. <strong>In-product communications.</strong> We may use the information you provide to contact you through vScheduler using several in-product messaging tools. 
																								For example, if, after, a few weeks of using vScheduler we notice that your notification setting is set to notify you of all messages, we may send you an in-app message that suggests you change this in case you are getting too many notifications. 
																								This is just one example of how we use information about your usage of the product to make suggestions to you.
																							</li><br/>
																							<li>
																								iii. <strong>Email messages.</strong> We may send users service and administrative emails, such as service welcome messages and password reset messages. 
																								We may also contact users to inform them about changes in our services, our service offerings and important service related notices, such as changes to this policy or security and fraud notices. 
																								These messages are considered part of the service and you may not opt-out of them. 
																								In addition, we sometimes send emails to vScheduler users about new product features or other news about vScheduler. You can opt-out of these at any time.

															<h3>ACCOUNT PRIVACY OPTIONS</h3>

															<p>
																When you use vScheduler, you have control over a number of things with respect to your own privacy and choices about how your content is visible to others or not. 
																If you are a vScheduler client or administrator, you have additional choices that impact your account’s privacy level. Some users will not have access to all of the same choices that their employer or administrator(s) do. 
																That is because vScheduler is set up to be client-oriented, and provides its clients with the maximum ability to control their account.
															</p>
															<p class="font-weight-bold">
																Data Retention & Export Options
															</p>
															<p>
																vScheduler offers different options for data retention and export to clients and administrators, depending on the level of service they have subscribed for. 
																These service levels are likely to change so please contact your administrator to learn more about which features are associated with which subscription or service level.
															</p>
															
															<div class="text">
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li>
																				1. <strong>Data Retention Settings</strong>
																				<div class="row justify-content-center">
																					<div class=" col-10">
																						<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																							<li>
																								i. Data retention setting options vary by service level from very general to very specific. The default for clients, at all service levels, is that data is retained for as long as the account exists unless it is deleted by the user or administrators, and that users can edit and delete their own data at any time.
																							</li><br/>
																							<li>
																								ii.	Premium service accounts can modify their account settings to shorten the duration of retention, make very specific retention setting modifications on a per-channel basis, and change settings to store all appointment edits and to retain data that users have deleted.
																							</li><br/>
																							<li>
																								iii. Please see our FAQ for more specific information about what options exist for different account service levels.
																							</li>
																						</ul>
																					</div>
																				</div>
																			</li>
																			
																			<li>
																				2. <strong>Message Exports</strong>
																				<div class="row justify-content-center">
																					<div class=" col-10">
																						<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																							<li>
																								i. Administrators of all accounts, at all service levels, can export their account’s data and files that are published. Appointment history or messages for premium private accounts are not included in this.
																							</li><br/>
																							<li>
																								ii.	Only clients with accounts that have the appropriate service level for vScheduler and have enabled “compliance” Exports can export their accounts’ data that has been set to a private status, private appointments, shared files and private messages. “Compliance” Exports may include appointment edit and deletion history.
																							</li><br/>
																							<li>
																								iii. For more information about your account's export options, please contact your account administrator.

Deactivation of a personal account disables the user’s access to the vScheduler client account associated with that personal account but does not delete the users profile or content, which are considered part of client account’s data.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				2. Whether you can delete your message content depends on your client account’s settings. In addition, a record of edits and deletions may be retained by the client account, depending on the service level set in the client account settings. Please see our FAQ for more detail.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				3. While you cannot completely delete a profile once it is created, you can update your profile information at any time and modify your email settings. You can also change your user name from time to time.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				4. When you create an appointment, send a message, or upload a document or a file on vScheduler, you can share this data with specific individuals or user groups within that client account. You can also share them externally by creating a public link if you choose depending on privacy settings set by the administrator. Files are not subject to message retention settings but can be deleted at any time by the person who uploaded the file or by account administrators.

																Sharing and Disclosure
															</p>

															<p>
																There are times when communications and related content and other user information may be shared by vScheduler. This section discusses only how vScheduler may share user information. 
																Organizations that use vScheduler may have their own policies for sharing and disclosure of information they can access through vScheduler. vScheduler may share information:
															</p>

															<div class="text">
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				1.	<strong>With consent, to comply with legal process,</strong>  or to protect vScheduler and our users. When we have your consent or if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or vScheduler; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. If we receive a law enforcement or other third party request for information we will provide prior notice to the subject of the request where we are legally permitted to do so. For more information on vScheduler’s policies for responding to requests for user data, please see our Data Request Policy.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				2.	<strong>With approved third party service providers and agents.</strong>  We may employ third party companies or individuals that are verified or approved by the client company to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at preventing unauthorized access or with an email vendor to send messages on our behalf. We may also share data with hosting providers, payment processors, marketing vendors, and other consultants who work on our behalf.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				3.	<strong>Integrations.</strong>  If you add an integration, vScheduler may share information about the client or account with the provider of the integration. vScheduler is not responsible for how the provider of the integration may collect and use your data.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				4.	<strong>About you with your organization or administrator(s).</strong>
																				<div class="row justify-content-center">
																					<div class=" col-10">
																						<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																							<li class="pb-1">
																								i. We may share your email address and account activity with your organization. If the email address under which you've registered your account belongs to or is controlled by an organization (to be clear, we’re not talking about free web-based email providers like Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo! Mail) we may disclose that email address and associated data to that organization in order to help it understand who associated with that organization uses vScheduler, and to assist the organization with its enterprise accounts. Please do not use a work email address for our services unless you are authorized to do so, and are therefore comfortable with this kind of sharing.
																							</li>
																							<li class="pb-1">
																								ii.	In addition, there may be times when you contact vScheduler to help resolve an issue specific to your account. In order to help resolve the issue, we may need to share your concern with your administrator. When possible, we will try to mask or remove any identifying information before sharing these communications.
																							</li>
																							<li class="pb-1">
																								iii. As described above in the Data Retention and Export Options section, users and administrators have certain rights to export their account's data and files.
																							</li>
																							<li class="pb-1">
																								iv. If we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, sale of some or all of vScheduler's assets financing, acquisition of all or a portion of our business, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Privacy Policy.
																							</li>
																							<li class="pb-1">
																								v. We may also share aggregated or de-identified information with our partners or others for business or research purposes. For example, we may tell a prospective vScheduler customer the average number of appointments or visitors sent within a vScheduler account in a day or may partner with research firm or academics to explore interesting questions about workplace communications and operations. Again, this policy is not intended to prohibit the disclosure and use of aggregated or de-identified data.

																vScheduler takes reasonable steps to protect information you provide to us as part of your use of the vScheduler service from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access or disclosure. These steps take into account the sensitivity of the information we collect, process and store and the current state of technology. When you enter sensitive information (such as sign-in credentials) we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no electronic or email transmission or digital storage mechanism is ever fully secure or error free.

																To learn more about current practices and policies regarding security and confidentiality, please see our Security Practices; we keep that document updated as these practices evolve over time.

															<h2>COOKIE POLICY</h2>
															
															<div class="text">
																<p>
																	vScheduler uses cookies, or similar technologies like single-pixel gifs and web beacons, to record log data. We use both session-based and persistent cookies.
																</p>
																<p>
																	Cookies are small text files sent by us to your computer and from your computer to us, each time you visit our website. They are unique to your vScheduler account or your browser. Session-based cookies last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire.
																</p>
																<p>
																	Some cookies are associated with your vScheduler account and personal information in order to remember that you are logged in and which account you are logged into. Other cookies are not tied to your vScheduler account but are unique and allow us to do site analytics and customization, among other similar things. If you access vScheduler through your browser, you can manage your cookie settings there but if you disable all cookies you may not be able to use vScheduler.
																</p>
																<p>
																	vScheduler sets and accesses our own cookies on our company-owned domains. In addition, we use 3rd parties like Google Analytics for website analytics. You may opt-out of third party cookies from Google Analytics via its website. We do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals as there is no consistent industry standard for compliance.

															<h2>DATA REQUEST POLICY</h2>
															
															<div class="text">
																<p>vScheduler would like to share with our clients, as well as those who may be contemplating asking vScheduler to disclose user data, our policies on responding to such requests:</p>
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>1.</strong>   vScheduler is a service provider to other businesses, and as such, requests for user data should be referred in the first instance to the client company or facility administrator. If you send a data request to vScheduler and the data is accessible to the client or individual user, we will start by forwarding your request to the impacted client, so it is best to start there first.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>2.</strong>   vScheduler provides prior notice to impacted clients, facility administrators, or where appropriate, individual users, when legal process is received in criminal or civil matters and such disclosure is not specifically prohibited by law or where vScheduler determines in its sole discretion that providing notice could create a risk of harm to specific people, to children or to vScheduler’s rights and property interests including the security of its network.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>3.</strong>   vScheduler requires that any individual or party issuing legal process to vScheduler properly domesticate the process and serve vScheduler in a jurisdiction where it is resident or has a registered agent to accept service on its behalf.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>4.</strong>   vScheduler does not disclose account content absent a search warrant in criminal cases. In civil cases, vScheduler cannot disclose content without sufficient legal process and the consent of the appropriate vScheduler client(s) or user(s).
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>5.</strong>   Clients and facility administrators have flexibility to configure the data retention options for their accounts. These settings govern the vast majority of data collected by vScheduler. For more information on the types of data that vScheduler collects and for how long such data is retained, please see our Privacy Policy.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>6.</strong>   Content removal requests should be directed to client companies or facility administrators. As described in vScheduler’s Terms of Service, there are certain limitations on the appropriate use of vScheduler and vScheduler reserves the right to remove content that violates its policies. However, these decisions are better made in most cases by the client companies rather than vScheduler. vScheduler publishes a Transparency Report summarizing user data requests and content take down requests.
