															<p>
																We take the security of your data very seriously at vScheduler. As transparency is one of the principles on which our company is built, we aim to be as clear and open as we can about the way we handle security.
															</p>
															<p>
																If you have additional questions regarding the security of ours systems or our practices, we are happy to answer them. Please write to security@vscheduler.com and we will respond as quickly as we can.

															<p class="font-weight-bold">
																CONFIDENTIALITY
															</p>
															<p>
																We place strict controls over our employees’ access to the data you and your users make available via the vScheduler services, as more specifically defined in your agreement with vScheduler covering the use of the vScheduler services ("Client Data"), and are committed to ensuring that Client Data is not seen by anyone who should not have access to it. The operation of the vScheduler services requires that some employees have access to the systems which store and process Client Data. For example, in order to diagnose a problem you are having with the vScheduler services, we may need to access your Client Data. These employees are prohibited from using these permissions to view Client Data unless it is necessary to do so. We have technical controls and audit policies in place to ensure that any access to Client Data is logged.
															</p>
															<p>
																All of our employees and contract personnel are bound to our policies regarding Client Data and we treat these issues as matters of the highest importance within our service.
															</p>
															
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>

															<p class="font-weight-bold">
																PERSONNEL PRACTICES
															</p>
															<p>
																vScheduler conducts background checks on all employees before employment, and employees receive security training during onboarding as well as on an ongoing basis. All employees are required to read and sign our comprehensive information security policy covering the security, availability, and confidentiality of the vScheduler services.
															</p>
															
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weight-bold">
																COMPLIANCE
															</p>
															<p>
																The following security-related audits and certifications are applicable to the vScheduler services:
															</p>

															<div class="text">
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li>
																				<strong>PCI:</strong>  vScheduler is not currently a PCI-certified Service Provider. We are a PCI Level 4 Merchant and have completed the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard’s SAQ-A, allowing us to use a third party to process your credit card information securely.
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																	</div>
																</div>
															</div>

															<p>
																The environment that hosts the vScheduler services maintains multiple certifications for its data centers, including ISO 27001 compliance, Payment Card Industry (PCI) Certification, and Service Organization Control (SOC) reports.
															</p>
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															
															<p class="font-weight-bold">
																SECURITY FEATURES FOR USERS & ADMINISTRATORS
															</p>
															<p>
																In addition to the work we do at the infrastructure level, we provide client administrators of various subscription levels of the vScheduler services with additional tools to enable their own users to protect their User Data.
															</p>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																Access Logging
															</p>
															<p>
																Detailed access logs are available both to users and administrators of the service. We log every time an account signs in, noting the type of device used and the IP address of the connection.
															</p>
															<p>
																Account administrators and client companies can review consolidated access logs for their entire account. We also make it easy for administrators to remotely terminate all connections and sign out all devices authenticated to the vScheduler services at any time, on-demand.
															</p>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																Two-Factor Authentication
															</p>
															<p>
																Account administrators can require all users to set up two-factor authentication on their accounts. Instructions for doing this are available in our FAQ.
															</p>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																Data Retention
															</p>
															<p>
																Owners of vScheduler accounts can configure custom data retention policies on a client-wide and per-user group basis. Setting a custom duration for retention means that data or files older than the duration you set will be deleted on a nightly basis.
															</p>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																Deletion of Client or User Data
															</p>
															<p>
																vScheduler provides the option for account administrators to delete Client Data at any time during a subscription term. Within 24 hours of the administrators initiated deletion, vScheduler hard deletes all information from currently-running production systems (excluding account and user names in web server access logs). vScheduler services backups are destroyed after 30 days.
															</p>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																Return of Client or User Data
															</p>
															<p>
																The vScheduler services include the following export capabilities:
															</p>
															<div class="text">
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>Standard Exports:</strong>  During a subscription term, administrators of an annual vScheduler subscription can export Client or User Data from the account, but not from appointments, messages, or files marked with a “high” privacy level.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>Compliance Exports:</strong>  In addition to ‘Standard Exports’, to the extent the ‘Compliance Exports’ feature is enabled by an administrator of a more advanced vScheduler subscription can also export Client or User Data from data marked with a “high” privacy level during a subscription term. These exports can be initiated at any time during a subscription term, or at regular scheduled intervals during a subscription term for archival purposes.
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																	</div>
																</div>
															</div>
															<p>
																More information about the export capabilities of the vScheduler services can be found at our Support Center.

																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																DATA ENCRYPTION IN-TRANSIT
															</p>
															<p>
																The vScheduler services support the latest recommended secure cipher suites and protocols to encrypt all traffic in transit. We monitor the changing cryptographic landscape closely and work promptly to upgrade the service to respond to new cryptographic weaknesses as they are discovered and implement best practices as they evolve, while also balancing the need for compatibility for older clients.

															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																AVAILABILITY
															</p>
															<p>
																We understand that you rely on the vScheduler services to work. We're committed to making vScheduler a highly-available service that you can count on. Our infrastructure runs on systems that are fault tolerant, for failures of individual servers or even entire data centers. Our operations team tests disaster-recovery measures regularly and staffs an around-the-clock on-call team to quickly resolve unexpected incidents.
															</p>
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																DISASTER RECOVERY
															</p>
															<p>
																Client Data is stored redundantly at multiple locations in our hosting provider’s data centers to ensure availability. We have well-tested backup and restoration procedures, which allow recovery from a major disaster. Client Data and our source code are automatically backed up nightly. The Operations team is alerted in case of a failure with this system. Backups are fully tested at least every 90 days to confirm that our processes and tools work as expected.
															</p>
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																NETWORK PROTECTION
															</p>
															<p>
																In addition to sophisticated system monitoring and logging, we have implemented two-factor authentication for all server access across our production environment. Firewalls are configured according to industry best practices and unnecessary ports are blocked by our server configurations.
															</p>
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																HOST MANAGEMENT
															</p>
															<p>
																We perform automated vulnerability scans on our production hosts and remediate any findings that present a risk to our environment. We enforce screens lockouts and the usage of full disk encryption for company laptops.
															</p>
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																LOGGING
															</p>
															<p>

These logs are analyzed for security events via automated monitoring software, overseen by the security team.
															</p>
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																INCIDENT MANAGEMENT & RESPONSE
															</p>
															<p>
																In the event of a security breach, vScheduler will promptly notify you of any unauthorized access to your Client Data. vScheduler has incident management policies and procedures in place to handle such an event as are outlined in each subscription’s Service Level Agreement (SLA).
															</p>
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																EXTERNAL SECURITY AUDITS
															</p>
															<p>
																We contract with respected external security firms who perform regular audits of the vScheduler services to verify that our security practices are sound and to monitor the vScheduler services for new vulnerabilities discovered by the security research community. In addition to periodic and targeted audits of the vScheduler services and features, we also employ the use of continuous hybrid automated scanning of our web platform.
															</p>
															<div class="post-share-options">
																<div class="post-share-inner clearfix">
																	
																</div>
															</div>
															<p class="font-weigt-bold">
																PRODUCT SECURITY PRACTICES
															</p>
															<p>
																New features, functionality, and design changes go through a security review process facilitated by our security team. In addition, our code is audited with automated static analysis software, tested, and manually peer-reviewed prior to being deployed to production. The security team works closely with development teams to resolve any additional security concerns that may arise during development.
