															<div class="text">
																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>1.1</strong>	This Terms of Service document (the “TOS”), is an agreement you must accept in order to use vScheduler’s Service (as defined below). It is applicable to (a) “Clients” - this includes Primary Clients who initially set up the Service and other Sub-Clients that are granted administrative privileges by the Primary Client; (b) Administrators – those who manage and run an account or user group (“Administrators”) (Clients and Administrators, collectively “Administrative Users”), and to c) Users – users who are invited or enabled to join an existing account that has already been created in the Service by an Administrator (“Users”). The terms “you” and “users” encompass all users, including both Administrative Users and Users. This document describes both your rights and your obligations as part of using the Service. It is important that you read it carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms. vScheduler (“vScheduler” “we” “us”) only provides its Service (as defined below) to you subject to this TOS. By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by this TOS (including the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated here by reference).
																			</li>

																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>1.2</strong>	If you are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its Users, its Administrative Users, and its affiliates to this TOS. In that case, the terms “you” or “your” shall also refer to such entity, its Users, its Administrative Users, and its affiliates, as applicable. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this TOS, you may not use the Service. You acknowledge that this TOS is a contract between you and vScheduler, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and vScheduler, and it governs your use of the Service.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>1.3</strong>	As our service evolves, vScheduler may change this TOS. If we make a material change to the TOS, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the changes either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Site. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time by visiting this page. The revised terms and conditions will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and if you use the Service after that date, your use will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this TOS is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to cancel your account and stop using the Services, or otherwise through the process provided in the Service.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>1.4</strong>	As part of the registration process, you will identify a Client by name and provide a Primary Administrator’s user name (in the form of an email address) and password for your account. You may use these credentials to invite or enable individuals to become Administrative Users and Users (each with their own password) under the Client account. The total number of users is limited to the maximum number permitted for your subscription plan. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login, password, and account and for all activities that occur under your login or account, including the activities of Users.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>1.5</strong>	All users should be aware that your Administrative Users may have certain rights to access your account and may obtain related information in connection with the Services. The Administrators also set policies regarding your use of various aspects of the Services, including retention settings and the ability to preserve and export all communications in the account. As these rights may vary depending on the account, please see our FAQ for general information about account classifications, and refer to your Administrator if you have questions regarding your particular account such as your account settings. Please also see the Privacy Policy for more information on these topics. Administrators are solely responsible for informing users of the applicable company policies, obtaining any legally required user consent to such policies, and for ensuring that all uses of the Services comply with applicable federal, state and/or international privacy laws.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>1.6</strong>	By accessing or using the Services, you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age (or have reached the age of majority if that is not 18 years of age where you live). You represent that you are fully able and competent to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions in this TOS. The Service is not directed to children under 13, so if you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to access or use the Services. If we become aware that you are using the Service even though you are under 13, we will deactivate your account.

															<P class="font-weight-bold">2.  DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</P>
															<p>
																The “Service(s)” means (a) vScheduler’s real-time scheduling, calendar, communication, messaging, archiving, reporting and search services and related systems and technologies, as well as the website https://www.vscheduler.com (the “Site”), and (b) all software (including the Software, as defined below), applications, data, reports, text, images, and other content made available by or on behalf of vScheduler through any of the foregoing. The “Service” does not include Your Data (as defined below) or any software application or service that is provided by you or a third party, which you use in connection with the Service, whether or not vScheduler designates them as “official integrations” (each a “Non-vScheduler Product”). Any modifications and new features added to the Service are also subject to this TOS. vScheduler reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Service (or any Service plan) or any feature or functionality thereof at any time without notice to you. All rights, title and interest in and to the Service and its components (including all intellectual property rights) will remain with and belong exclusively to vScheduler.

																<div class="row justify-content-center">
																	<div class="col-10">
																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>3.1</strong>	You may access and use the Service only for lawful, authorized purposes and you shall not misuse the Service in any manner (as determined by vScheduler in its sole discretion). Please see our guidelines for Acceptable Use for specific provisions outlining prohibited uses of the Service. Administrative Users shall be responsible for all actions by Users on their account. You shall comply with any codes of conduct, policies, storage limitations, or other notices vScheduler provides you or publishes in connection with the Service from time to time, but if any of those policies materially change the TOS, we will provide you with reasonable notice as provided in Section 1.3 above. You shall promptly notify vScheduler if you learn of a security breach related to the Service.
																			</li>

																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>3.2</strong>	Any software that may be made available by or on behalf of vScheduler in connection with the Service, including vScheduler’s mobile and desktop applications, (“Software”) contains proprietary and confidential information that is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws. Subject to the terms and conditions of this TOS, vScheduler only grants you a personal, non-sublicensable and non-exclusive license to use the object code of any Software solely in connection with the Service. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>3.3</strong>	vScheduler reserves the right to use your name as a reference for marketing or promotional purposes on the Site and in other communication with existing or potential vScheduler customers. For example, we might list your company on one of our webpages under lists of vScheduler customers. We do not want to list customers who do not want to be listed, so you may send an email to feedback@vscheduler.com stating that you do not wish to be used as a reference.
																			</li>
																			<li class="pb-2">
																				<strong>3.4</strong>	vScheduler may make available, in its sole discretion, the vScheduler Application Programming Interface and related documentation, data, code, and other materials provided with the API (collectively “API”) through our developer site located at https://api.vscheduler.com/. Use of this API is governed by this TOS and the vScheduler API Terms of Service (“API TOS”). You hereby agree to be bound by those terms, and acknowledge that violation of vScheduler’s TOS or vScheduler’s API TOS is grounds for termination of Your Account.

																		<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
																			<li>
																				<strong>4.1</strong>	"Your Data" means any data and content you upload, post, transmit or otherwise made available via the Services (which may include data you elect to import from Non-vScheduler Products you use). "Your Data" includes appointments you schedule, messages you send, files you upload, comments you make on files, profile information and anything else you enter or upload into the Service. vScheduler will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all facilities used to store and process Your Data meet a high standard for security. Please see our Privacy Policy and Security Practices for more information on our current practices and policies regarding data privacy, security and confidentiality. We keep those documents updated as these practices and policies evolve over time.
																			</li>

																			<li>
																				<strong>4.2</strong>	In order for us to provide the Service to you, we require that you grant us certain rights with respect to Your Data. For example, we need to be able to transmit, store and copy Your Data in order to display it to you and your colleagues, to index it so you are able to search it, to make backups to prevent data loss, and so on. Your acceptance of this TOS gives us the permission to do so and grants us any such rights necessary to provide the service to you, only for the purpose of providing the service (and for no other purpose). This permission includes allowing us to use third-party service providers in the operation and administration of the Service and the rights granted to us are extended to these third parties to the degree necessary in order for the Service to be provided.
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				<strong>4.3</strong>	If any users send us any feedback or suggestions regarding the Service, you grant vScheduler an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, free license to use any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose without any obligation to you.
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				<strong>4.4</strong>	You are solely responsible for your conduct (including by and between all users), the content of Your Data, and all communications with others while using the Services. We may choose to review Public Content (as defined below) for compliance with our policies and guidelines, but you acknowledge that vScheduler has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services. However, vScheduler may remove or disable any Public Content at any time for any reason or for no reason at all. We are not responsible for the accuracy, appropriateness, or legality of Your Data or any other information you and your users may be able to access using the Services. The Services provide features that allow you and your users to share Your Data and other materials with others or to make it public. Please consider carefully what you allow to be shared or made public.

You agree to pay vScheduler in accordance with the terms set forth on the Site and this TOS, and you authorize vScheduler or its third-party payment processors to bill your payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with such terms.

																				<strong>5.2</strong>	If you dispute any charges you must let vScheduler know within sixty (60) days after the date that vScheduler invoices you. All amounts paid are non-refundable and we reserve the right to change our prices in the future. If we increase our prices for your Service plan, we will provide notice of the change on the Site and in email to you at least 30 days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change goes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. vScheduler may choose to bill you through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued must be received by the date specified in the invoice. Past due fees are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services based on vScheduler’s net income.
